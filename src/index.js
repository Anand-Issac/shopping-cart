import React from 'react';

import App from './App';




ReactDOM.render(
    
    <App/>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);


/* Credits:
    I learned how React components work, how to pass data through components, and state rendering
    from the official React docs (I completed the tic tac toe tutorial :P)

    All the auth and storage was handled by Firebase. They made it very easy for me to integrate it into 
    my app.

    The HTML and CSS for the sign in/ sign up in the loading page was done by Florin Pop
    https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/03/double-slider-sign-in-up-form/
    It looks really awesome and you should check it out!
